this is my first project with "The Odin Project". Excited to learn!

## End-of-Project Reflection Section
I took courses in highschool doing exactly this. I heavily regret not continuing to code. I didnt realise how close I was to being employable.
The course has taken me probably 2 weeks to get to this point and it pretty much covered what I learned in my entire first semester / year of coding.
