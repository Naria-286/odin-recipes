    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside, these roast potatoes are the ultimate side dish. 
        The secret lies in par-boiling the potatoes, roughing up their edges, and roasting them in hot oil for a golden, 
        crispy finish. A sprinkle of sea salt and fresh rosemary adds the perfect touch of flavor. Ideal for a Sunday roast or any special occasion.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1.2kg floury potatoes, such as Maris Piper or King Edward</li>
        <li>100g goose or duck fat (or olive oil)</li>
        <li>2 tbsp semolina</li>
        <li>2 garlic cloves</li>
        <li>Few rosemary sprigs</li>
        <li>Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Preheat the oven to 200°C/Fan 180°C/Gas 6. 
            Peel the potatoes, chop into large chunks and place in a large saucepan of cold salted water. 
            Bring to the boil then simmer for about 6 minutes.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, add the goose fat (or duck fat or oil) to a large roasting tray and place in the oven to heat up.</li>
        <li>
            Drain the potatoes in a colander and give them a gentle shake to fluff up the edges. 
            Sprinkle over the semolina, shake again to coat evenly then leave to steam dry for 5 minutes. 
            Leave the garlic cloves whole but crush lightly with the back of your hand or the flat side of a large knife.
        </li>
        <li>Carefully add the potatoes to the hot tray along with the garlic and rosemary. Toss to coat in the fat and spread out in a single layer so they cook evenly.</li>
        <li>Roast for 40-45 minutes, turning every 15 minutes, until crisp and golden brown. Season with sea salt and freshly ground black pepper to serve.</li>
    </ol>
